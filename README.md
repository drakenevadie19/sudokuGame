# sudokuGame
- Inspired by traditional sudoku games, I designed a web page for users to solve their mazes, and also play Sudoku there
- There are 2 parts in this game: 
  - Users type in their mazes and they can be solved/identify whether they can be solved or not.
  - Users can also play games here. I use Backtracking to generate a random maze for them.

- About tech stacks:
  - Programming Languages: TypeScripts, HTML, CSS
  - Front-end library: Angular (Ngrx, RxJS, AngularCLI)
  - UI additional library: Bootstrap5, Material UI, SweetAlert
