# sudokuGame
Inspired by traditional sudoku games, I design a web page for users to solve their mazes, and also play Sudoku there
There are 2 parts in this game: 
  - Users type in their mazes and they can be solved/identify whether they can be solved or not.
  - Users can also play games here. I use Backtracking to generate a maze for them.
