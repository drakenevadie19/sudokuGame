# sudokuGame
- Inspired by traditional sudoku games, I designed a web page for users to solve their mazes, and also play Sudoku there
- There are 2 parts in this game: 
  - Users type in their mazes and they can be solved/identify whether they can be solved or not.
  - Users can also play games here. I use Backtracking to generate a random maze for them.
 
- Responsibility:
  - Designed and architectured a responsive design website, using the Angular framework, associated with pure HTML, CSS, and TypeScript, with Material UI.
  - Improved Web UI performance by 30% by using Angular features, from NgRx and RxJS, such as Lazy Loading, BehaviorSubject, ...
  - Improve the performance of solving the Sudoku maze by 80%, by using the Backtracking algorithm.
  - Implement the same algorithm, Backtracking, to generate unique-solution and non-repeated sudoku quizzes for players.

- About tech stacks:
  - Programming Languages: TypeScripts, HTML, CSS
  - Front-end library: Angular (Ngrx, RxJS, AngularCLI)
  - UI additional library: Bootstrap5, Material UI, SweetAlert
